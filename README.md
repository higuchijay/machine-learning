# machine-learning
A naive bayes classifier that predicts whether a movie review is either positive ("this movie is well written and has fantastic acting") or negative ("terrible acting and animation, poor writing"). It takes a sample list of 1000+ positive and negative reviews as a "training data set", with each review indicating whether it is positive or negative (1 for positive, 0 for negative). Then, the program applies a naive bayes classifying algorithm to "train" the program using the training data set so it could classify certain buzz words as positive or negative. For example, in the training set, there would probably be several reviews that contain the word "bad". Using this data, the classifier is able to decide whether an input review is positive or negative by checking whether it contains these words.
